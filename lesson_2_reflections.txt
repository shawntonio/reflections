What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git folder that holds all the history data. I need to do it in order to be able to track my commits.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary cache to hold the files you are getting ready to commit.
